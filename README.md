# Attendance-py V-1.0

make sure that these three files are in same folder
how it will work?
there is a csv file which contains data about students
we read that file using pandas
after finding the numbe of rows, we will iterate a loop to store p or a in a list that is in the size of rows
we will add new column name as date and data, that is this list.
we will add all the data in one csv file and also generate seperate csv file to each date
at the end , we will plot a graph to presenties and absenties
